# Huffman En/Decoding systeam  
This system supports effective Huffman encoding and decoding for a wide range of non-English languages including Chinese, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Russian, and others, as well as special characters.

# How to use   
To encode text, prepare your content without worrying about language, script, or special characters, and place it in a text file (1.txt). Our application will then process the original text file, automatically generating a code table (2.txt) and the encoded text (encodedFile.txt), both of which will be written and stored in corresponding text files in the same directory.

After the code table file (2.txt) and the encoded text file (encodedFile.txt) have been transferred or otherwise processed, you can decode them by running our application again in the same directory. The program will automatically generate the decoded text and save it to a corresponding text file (3.txt) in the same directory.

Users don't need to understand the details of Huffman trees or Huffman coding, nor the specifics of the encoding/decoding process implemented in the program. There's no need for any environment configuration or debugging on the computer. Simply run our provided program to perform encoding/decoding operations on your text content.
